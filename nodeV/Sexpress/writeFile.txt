* fs.writeFile("form-data.txt", Buffer.concat(allData).toString(), (error)=> ..

    -> wheter occurs or not third callback always run, we need to handle inisde it, that 
       if error than do this otherwise do this. So this callback fn is use to end response, 
       because if u end outside of writeFile function, then it will throw error.

       Cannot set headers after they are sent to the client !!!

       This is because writeFile is Asynchronous fn, and res is ended earlier, so 
       when the callback will try to do some mutation on res ( otherwise fine ), 
       then it will throw error, because response has been already sent.


* I was writing into file normally, but it should be called inside callback of req.on( 'end', callback),
  because, untill whole data is not received we would either write no or incomplete data. In my case it
  was no data.
