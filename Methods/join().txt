* The join() method in JavaScript is used to join all the elements of an array into a single string. You can specify a separator to insert 
between each element, or if no separator is provided, it defaults to a comma.



* separator (optional): A string that separates the array elements in the resulting string. If omitted,
 the elements will be separated by commas by default.
